# citRon: Jacquemus-themed colour palettes for Sarah's MPhil thesis
Jacquemus is a French fashion label headed by Simon Porte Jacquemus that has achieved cult status over the 
past couple of years thanks to its whimsical, casual styles and eyebrow-raising accessories
(the most famous being a tiny bag incapable of holding much more than a single key).
I love how the label uses bold colours, and found inspiration in Jacquemus' Spring '19 and '20
collections when coming up with a colour palette for my thesis plots. 

Citrus fruits often feature as props in Jacquemus editorials, and Jacquemus himself owns a cafe
called "Citron", hence the package name `citRon` ("lemon" in English).

`citRon` includes a qualitative palette, a diverging palette, and various gradient palettes.
Particular shades have been chosen because I have been lead to believe that I have chosen
shades and combinations that are colourblind-friendly, but I am more than happy to entertain
any suggestions or tweaks that could be made.

These palettes have been constructed with a specific use in mind, especially `citron_grad_blue8`,
so do keep in mind that these will not always be useful or attractive for your circumstances.

This package, including the format of this vignette, has been copied-and-edited from 
the `ochRe` package by Holly Kirk et. al.
